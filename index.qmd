Welcome to the Causal Inference in R Blog!
Here you'll find more information about our packages, book, courses, and other information about causal inference. 

If you're looking for our book or workshop website, you can find them here:

* [Book](https://www.r-causal.org/)
* [Workshop](https://r-causal.github.io/causal_workshop_website/)

## R Packages

We develop opinionated R packages to make causal inference in R easier and more principled.
Our packages are designed to work well with each other and in the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
They're also quite modular, meaning you can pick and choose the packages you like to work in a wide variety of settings. You can find the source code for these packages on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/r-causal).
