Additionally, it can help build your intuition for which populations various weighting and matching strategies are working. Let’s explore some of the things halfmoon can help with.\n\n# install.packages(\"halfmoon\")\nlibrary(halfmoon)\n\nLet’s take a look at an example using the built-in dataset, nhefs_weights. nhefs_weights is an extension of the nhefs dataset that includes a variety of propensity-score weights for the causal question: “does quitting smoking increase weight?” You can find the data for this question in the causaldata package."

    "text": "Population-level balance\nThe main tool in halfmoon for assessing balance at the population level is geom_mirrored_histogram().\nHere’s the original, unweighted sample using geom_mirrored_histogram(). The histogram on top is the exposed population, those who quit smoking. The histogram on the bottom is the unexposed population, those who did not quit smoking. While there is a lot of overlap, it seems like the two groups are slightly different.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggokabeito)\n\nggplot(nhefs_weights, aes(.fitted)) +\n  geom_mirror_histogram(\n    aes(group = qsmk, fill = qsmk),\n    bins = 50\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the same population weighted using Average Treatment Effect (ATE) weights:\n\nggplot(nhefs_weights, aes(.fitted)) +\n  # plot the original distribution in dark grey\n  geom_mirror_histogram(\n    aes(group = qsmk),\n    bins = 50\n  ) +\n  geom_mirror_histogram(\n    aes(fill = qsmk, weight = w_ate),\n    bins = 50,\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) + scale_y_continuous(labels = abs) +\n  scale_fill_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nBoth groups are upweighted to be more similar.\nWith Average Treatment Effect among the Treated (ATT) weights, the untreated group is downweighted to be more similar to the treated group:\n\nggplot(nhefs_weights, aes(.fitted)) +\n  geom_mirror_histogram(\n    aes(group = qsmk),\n    bins = 50\n  ) +\n  geom_mirror_histogram(\n    aes(fill = qsmk, weight = w_att),\n    bins = 50,\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) + scale_y_continuous(labels = abs) +\n  scale_fill_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nMirrored histograms are really useful for the dual purpose of understanding how similar the weighted populations are and understanding exactly the population that is being analyzed."

    "text": "Variable-level balance\nAnother perspective on balance is whether or not the distribution of confounders is similar between groups of the exposed. The propensity score model fit for these weights was:\n\nlibrary(causaldata)\npropensity_model &lt;- glm(\n  qsmk ~ sex +\n    race + age + I(age^2) + education +\n    smokeintensity + I(smokeintensity^2) +\n    smokeyrs + I(smokeyrs^2) + exercise + active +\n    wt71 + I(wt71^2),\n  family = binomial(),\n  # these data are loaded with the causaldata package\n  data = nhefs_complete\n)\n\nOne way to assess if we achieved balance within the confounding variables is calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) of the confounder between exposure groups. The closer the SMD is to 0, the more balanced the groups are on average. A common rule of thumb is to have the SMD be less than 0.11.\nLet’s calculate the SMDs for each variable using the different weights in nhefs_weights. halfmoon’s tidy_smd() creates a dataset with the SMDs for each confounder, and geom_love() visualizes the relationship.\n\nplot_df &lt;- tidy_smd(\n  nhefs_weights,\n  race:active,\n  .group = qsmk,\n  .wts = starts_with(\"w_\")\n)\n\nggplot(\n  plot_df,\n  aes(\n    x = abs(smd),\n    y = variable,\n    group = method,\n    color = method\n  )\n) +\n  geom_love() +\n  scale_color_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nThis is called a Love plot, and you can use the love_plot() wrapper function to achieve the same goal:\n\nlove_plot(plot_df) +\n  scale_color_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nOne down side to SMD plots is that they only give you information about one statistic that focuses on the center of the variable. For a binary or categorical variable, that’s usually enough, but for a continuous variable, we could be balanced in the mean but unbalanced in the tails.\nLet’s take a look at smokeyrs, a continuish2 variable that represents the smoke-years a participant had prior to quitting smoking. We’ll use the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) to compare the differences between exposure groups across the range of smokeyers.\n\nggplot(\n  nhefs_weights,\n  aes(x = smokeyrs, color = qsmk)\n) +\n  geom_ecdf() +\n  xlab(\"Smoking Years\") +\n  ylab(\"Proportion &lt;= x\") +\n  scale_color_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s take a look with the ATE weight.\n\nggplot(\n  nhefs_weights,\n  aes(x = smokeyrs, color = qsmk)\n) +\n  geom_ecdf(aes(weights = w_ato)) +\n  xlab(\"Smoking Years\") +\n  ylab(\"Proportion &lt;= x\") +\n  scale_color_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\nThe balance is much better"
